%% Import the relevant signal data
% I converted the csv to a text file prior to using it because it was
% easier to import. 

signal_data_file = 'Signal.txt';                       % Grab the file name 
delimiter = ',';                                       % Set delimiter as a comma since data is seperated via commas
signal_data = importdata(signal_data_file,delimiter);  % Import the data 
time = 0:0.1:180.0;                                    % Create a time vector based on the sampling rate. (10Hz = 0.1s spanning 1801 points)      

% Initialize two empty arrays which will dynamically grow as we find peaks
peaks = [];             % Will hold the peak values 
timestamps = [];        % Will hold the time stamps at which the peaks are found 

signal_mean_value = 0.6833; % The expected true signal mean value 

%% Detrend the signal to remove the linear bias 

% We know that y(t) = s(t) + at. We also know that sum(s(t)) / length(t) = 0.6833
% We can use this information to derive the linear bias 'a': 
% sum( y(t) - s(t) ) / length(time)  =  0.6833
% => sum(y(t)) - sum(s(t)) = 0.6833 * length(time)  
% => sum(s(t)) = sum(y(t)) - ( 0.6833 * length(time) ) 

sum_st = sum(signal_data) - ( 0.6833 * length(time) );  % Sum of s(t)

% We know that sum(s(t)) = sum(at) = a * sum(time) therefore: 
a = sum_st / sum(time); 
signal_detrended = zeros(1,length(signal_data));        % Preallocate space for speed

% For loop which removes linear bias from each data point 
for i = 1:length(signal_data)
    signal_detrended(i) = signal_data(i) - (a * time(i));   % We recover the original signal 
end

%% Grab the peak values and positions of the peaks

% Construct a simple peak detection routine using a for loop. We do this by computing the
% gradients that come before and after a specific point. 
for i = 2:length(signal_detrended)-1
    
    last_Slope = (  signal_detrended(i) - signal_detrended(i-1) ) / (0.1);    % Keeps track of the previous gradient  
    next_Slope = (  signal_detrended(i+1) - signal_detrended(i) ) / (0.1);    % Keeps track of the next gradient
    
    if (last_Slope > 0) && (next_Slope < 0)     % If the gradient goes from positive to negative
        peaks = [peaks signal_detrended(i)];    % Append the peak value to the peak array
        timestamps = [timestamps time(i)];        % Append the time to the locations array (where the peak occured)

%% Prepare data structures prior to valid peak detection routine

% Combine the peak and location arrays into a single data structure. This
% makes it easier to handle both sets of data at the same time. 
peaks_locs = [peaks' timestamps'];

% Add a column of 'ones' to the data object. This column serves to 'flag'
% which peaks are valid (1) and which are invalid (0) All the peaks are
% initially flagged as valid.
