# special_peaks
A signal processing assignment I completed in MATLAB.

# DESCRIPTION
This was a signal processing task I was asked to complete as part of an intense interview process for a company creating wearable technology for sleep medicine. It features an interesting 'special peak' detection problem and requires an understanding of basic signal theory and MATLAB proficiency. 

The assignment goals are to:  
1. Remove signal drift 
2. Identify certain 'special peaks' in a signal based on specific criteria. More details about the exact assignment can be found in the 'Special Peak' pdf.

The signal is provided as a text file Signal.txt, and an 'expected mean value' of the signal is given as 0.6833
