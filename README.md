# special_peaks
A signal processing assignment I completed in MATLAB.

# DESCRIPTION
This was a signal processing task I was asked to complete as part of an intense interview process for a company creating wearable technology for sleep medicine. It features an interesting 'special peak' detection problem and requires an understanding of basic signal theory and MATLAB proficiency.
